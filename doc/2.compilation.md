# Compilation

IKVM includes two methods by which to compile Java byte code into .NET code. Dynamic and static. Dynamic compilation happens at runtime when Java code loads Java classes files. For instance, using a `URLClassLoader` to load a JAR file at runtime. While static compilation happens before you run your .NET application. The base Java classes included with IKVM itself are an example of static compilation.
